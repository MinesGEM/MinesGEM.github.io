##### Laura Leonard

Laura is a a PhD student in the Sharp group with a B.S. and M.S. in Environmental Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines. Her research focuses on studying the impacts of mountain pine beetle infestation, specifically, the biogeochemical alterations associated with pine beetle induced tree mortality in Crested Butte, CO.  By characterizing the soil gas flux, porewater, and microbial community shifts associated with pine needle decay, Laura hopes to determine the implications for forest recovery and nutrient export that could aid in the prediction for shifts in ecosystem function across montane watersheds.

### Spear Lab

#### Postdocs
Blake W. Stamps, Ph.D.

Blake Stamps is a Sloan Postdoctoral Fellow at the Colorado School of Mines. He received his bachelorâ€™s degree and Ph.D. from the University of Oklahoma in 2011 and 2016, both in Microbiology. His doctoral research investigated the role of bacteria and fungi in fouling and corrosion of fuel tanks storing a biodiesel blend used by the US Air Force. Since moving to the Colorado School of Mines, Dr. Stamps has explored the microbial community of the Orange County Water District Advanced Water Processing Facility and is currently focused on the risk of corrosion and biodeterioration caused by bacteria and fungi isolated from the International Space Station.

#### Graduate Students
Christopher Trivedi

##### Kalen Rasmussen

Kalen is currently a masters student in John Spear's lab.  He received his Bachelor's degree in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering from Mines as well. He has worked on a variety of projects ranging from the impacts of rare earth elements on the microbial communities in wastewater treatment plants with Dr. Munakata-Marr to the microbiota of sour style beers. Kalen is currently funded through the Enda Bailey Sussman Foundation and the National Park Service, focusing on laminated, lithified, silica based hot springs in Yellowstone National Park. By exploring the living microbial communities, geochemical cycles, and lithified biomat associated with these hot springs I hope to link the lithified past with the living present.
