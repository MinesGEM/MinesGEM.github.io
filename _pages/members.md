#####Laura Lenonard

Laura is a a PhD student in the Sharp group with a B.S. and M.S. in Environmental Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines. Her research focuses on studying the impacts of mountain pine beetle infestation, specifically, the biogeochemical alterations associated with pine beetle induced tree mortality in Crested Butte, CO.  By characterizing the soil gas flux, porewater, and microbial community shifts associated with pine needle decay, Laura hopes to determine the implications for forest recovery and nutrient export that could aid in the prediction for shifts in ecosystem function across montane watersheds.
