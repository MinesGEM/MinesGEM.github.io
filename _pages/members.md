## Current Lab Members

## Munakata-Marr Lab

### Graduate Students

#### Olivia Salmon

![oliviathumb](/images/osalmon_thumb.jpg)

Olivia is a master's student in Dr. Munakata-Marr's lab and is researching impacts of rare earth elements on the microbial communities of wastewater treatment systems. Olivia has a prior M.S. in Human Dimensions of Ecosystem Science and Management from Utah State University and has worked most recently in environmental consulting, with a focus on environmental assessments, subsurface investigations, landfill gas and groundwater monitoring, and regulatory permitting and compliance guidance for industrial facilities.

## Sharp Lab

### Postdoctoral Researchers

#### Kristin M. Mikkelson, Ph.D.

![kristinthumb](/images/km_thumb.jpg)

Kristin is a Research Associate in the Sharp lab with interests at the interface of environmental microbiology and hydrology. She received her bachelor's in Environmental Engineering from Cornell University and her Ph.D. in Hydrology from the Colorado School of Mines. Kristin's doctoral research investigated the affects of large-scale tree death on biogeochemical and hydrologic cycles. Her post-doctoral work shifted slightly and dove into the smaller-scale impacts of tree death on near-surface microbial processes. Her expertise also expanded during this tenure as she began investigating microbial processes in relation to nutrient cycling in engineered wetlands designed to treat impaired waters.

### Graduate Students

#### Laura Leonard

![laurathumb](/images/lleonard_thumb.jpg)

Laura is a a PhD student in the Sharp group with a B.S. and M.S. in Environmental Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines. Her research focuses on studying the impacts of mountain pine beetle infestation, specifically, the biogeochemical alterations associated with pine beetle induced tree mortality in Crested Butte, CO.  By characterizing the soil gas flux, porewater, and microbial community shifts associated with pine needle decay, Laura hopes to determine the implications for forest recovery and nutrient export that could aid in the prediction for shifts in ecosystem function across montane watersheds.

#### Michael Vega

![mikethumb](/images/mavega_thumb.jpg)

Michael is a Hydrology PhD student working in the Sharp group. He completed his BS in geochemistry at Kansas State University, with a particular interest in metal cycling in groundwater. Michael focuses on nitrogen biogeochemistry in a wetland biofilm that treats eutrophic river water.  Specifically, Michael is looking at how nitrogen bioremediation is coupled with other elemental cycles (i.e., carbon, metals), and how these combined cycles can promote microbial syntrophy. 

#### Adam Brady
![adamthumb](/images/Abrady_thumb.jpg)

Adam is a PhD student working in the Sharp group, with a M.S. in Environmental Science and Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines. Adam previously worked with the Cath group at the School of Mines. Adam is also an active duty Army officer attending Mines under the Advanced Civil Schooling program. Once he's completed his PhD, Adam will return to the United States Military Academy as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering. Adam is interested in constructed wetlands, water/wastewater/produced water treatment, life cycle analysis, and sustainability.

## Spear Lab

### Postdoctoral Researchers

#### Blake W. Stamps, Ph.D.

![blakethumb](/images/bstamps_thumb.jpg)

Blake Stamps is a Sloan Postdoctoral Fellow at the Colorado School of Mines. He received his bachelor’s degree and Ph.D. from the University of Oklahoma in 2011 and 2016, both in Microbiology. His doctoral research investigated the role of bacteria and fungi in fouling and corrosion of fuel tanks storing a biodiesel blend used by the US Air Force. Since moving to the Colorado School of Mines, Dr. Stamps has explored the microbial community of the Orange County Water District Advanced Water Processing Facility and is currently focused on the risk of corrosion and biodeterioration caused by bacteria and fungi isolated from the International Space Station.

### Graduate Students

#### Christopher Trivedi

![christhumb](/images/ctrivedi_thumb.jpg)

Chris is a polar and geomicrobiologist with special interests in astro- and extreme microbiology. His graduate research has focused on characterizing a low-temperature sulfidic spring system, Borup Fiord Pass, in the Canadian High Arctic. Borup is known as one of the best terrestrial analogs for studying conditions that might be present on the Jovian moon Europa. Chris work primarily uses genomic techniques to understand how microorganisms play a role in sulfur cycling under adverse conditions in such a cold environment. In the near future Chris’ work will be transition to a more culture-centered research focus where he will be studying glacial algae and their impact on melt rates.

#### Emily Kraus

![emilythumb](/images/ekraus_thumb.jpg)

Emily is a Ph.D. student in John Spear's lab and is also associated with the NASA Astrobiology Institute’s Rock-Powered Life group. For her dissertation, she is using field and lab work with ‘omics tools to characterize the metabolic capability, population dynamics, and identification of microbial life in the hyperalkaline fluids and solid rock of the serpentinizing subsurface in the Samail ophiolite of Oman. Emily also co-organized the first and second annual Rocky Mountain Geobiology Symposium (RMGS) in 2017/2018. Emily attended the International Geobiology Course in 2016, and before that received her B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Rochester where she worked with with John Tarduno on magnetotactic bacteria/magnetosomes.


#### Kalen Rasmussen

![kalenthumb](/images/kras_thumb.jpg)

Kalen is currently a masters student in John Spear's lab.  He received his Bachelor's degree in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering from Mines as well. He has worked on a variety of projects ranging from the impacts of rare earth elements on the microbial communities in wastewater treatment plants with Dr. Munakata-Marr to the microbiota of sour style beers. Kalen is currently funded through the Enda Bailey Sussman Foundation and the National Park Service, focusing on laminated, lithified, silica based hot springs in Yellowstone National Park. By exploring the living microbial communities, geochemical cycles, and lithified biomat associated with these hot springs I hope to link the lithified past with the living present.
