This course explores the diversity of microbiota in a few of the countless environments of our planet. Topics include microbial ecology (from a molecular perspective), microbial metabolism, pathogens, extreme environments, engineered systems, oxidation / reduction of metals, bioremediation of both organics and inorganics, microbial diversity, phylogenetics, analytical tools and bioinformatics. The course has an integrated laboratory component for applied molecular microbial ecology to learn microscopy, DNA extraction, PCR, gel electrophoresis, cloning, sequencing, data analysis and bioinformatic applications. Prerequisite: College Biology and/or CHGC562, CHGC563 or equivalent and enrollment in the ESE graduate program. 3 hours lecture, some field trips; 3 semester hours.
