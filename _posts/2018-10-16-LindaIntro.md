## About me

Linda is a volunteer in Dr. Spear’s lab and is fascinated by the wealth of biodiversity, complexity, interrelatedness of the world of the very small.  She is researching microbes and fungi from a mine that has been deactivated for a hundred years. Her research focuses on identifying the organisms that thrive in an acidic environment for possible uses in acid mine drainage remediation. Linda has a bachelor’s degree in biology and was a physical therapist for 45 years. After retirement she went back to her old love of biology.
