## A blurb about me

I’m a Ph.D. student working with John Spear and the NASA Astrobiology Institute’s Rock-Powered Life group. For my dissertation, I’m using field and lab work with ‘omics tools to characterize the metabolic capability, population dynamics, and identification of microbial life in the hyperalkaline fluids and solid rock of the serpentinizing subsurface in the Samail ophiolite of Oman. Blake and I co-organized the first and second annual Rocky Mountain Geobiology Symposium (RMGS) in 2017/2018. And I attended the amazing International Geobiology Course in 2016. I received my B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Rochester and was fortunate enough to do undergraduate research there with John Tarduno on magnetotactic bacteria/magnetosomes.

When I’m not working, I love playing ultimate frisbee with an awesome women’s team, Jackwagon, and an incredibly fun mixed team, All Jeeps, All Night. Besides frisbee, I enjoy doing anything with friends, traveling, lifting, and occasionally trying to learn how to dance.
