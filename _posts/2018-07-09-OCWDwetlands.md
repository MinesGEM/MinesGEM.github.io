The Orange County Water District has a [great new post](https://www.ocwd.com/news-events/newsletter/2018/may-2018/three-year-project-is-focus-during-american-wetlands-month/) describing some of the work the Sharp lab is up to in the Prado Wetlands. Check it out to see how Dr. Sharp and his students are using engineered wetlands as a less energy intensive method of nitrogen removal in water treatment.
