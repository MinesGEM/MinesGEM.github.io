## A blurb about me

My name is Michael Vega and I am a Hydrology PhD student working with Josh Sharp. I completed my BS in geochemistry at Kansas State University, where I thought a lot about metal cycling in groundwater. Now, my graduate work focuses on nitrogen biogeochemistry in a wetland biofilm that treats eutrophic river water. I’m particularly interested in how nitrogen bioremediation is coupled with other elemental cycles (i.e., carbon, metals), and how these combined cycles can promote microbial syntrophy. If I’m not in the lab or knee deep in wetland muck, I’m probably backpacking or enjoying a good beer (or both).
