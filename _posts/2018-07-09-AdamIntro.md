## A blurb about me
My name is Adam Brady. I’m a PhD student working with Dr Sharp. I received my Masters in Environmental Science and Engineering at Mines in 2012 working with Dr Cath. Additionally, I’m an active duty Army officer attending Mines under the Advanced Civil Schooling program. Upon completion of my PhD I will return to the United States Military Academy as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering.

My current academic interests are: constructed wetlands, water/wastewater/produced water treatment, life cycle analysis, and sustainability.
