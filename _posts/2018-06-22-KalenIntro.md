## A blurb about me
I am a Masters student studying Environmental Engineering under the advisement of John Spear at the Colorado School of Mines.  I received my Bachelor's degree in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering from Mines as well.  I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from the impacts of rare earth elements on the microbial communities in wastewater treatment plants to the microbiota of sour style beers.  Through the Enda Bailey Sussman Foundation and the National Park Service, my current project focuses on laminated, lithified, silica based hot springs in Yellowstone National Park.  By exploring the living microbial communities, geochemical cycles, and lithified biomat associated with these hot springs I hope to link the lithified past with the living present of these dynamic environmental systems.  Additionally, I will strive to uncover the coupling of abiotic, biotic, and genetic processes that influence these hot spring systems.
